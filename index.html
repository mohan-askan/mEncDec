description: Encryption & Decryption in Vanilla JS

This can be used with all js frameworks as this is based on vanilla Js. This is based on a very basic encryption and decryption technique. This is just an initiative. With your efforts, I beleive we could create a more secure one soon. Thanks for having a look at this.

The following were the steps to use this js plugin.

Add this js file to your webpage

{% highlight html %}
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mohan-askan/mencdec@master/mEncDec.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

To encrypt a string

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript">
    var mencdec = new mEncDec("test123");
    var encrypt = mencdec.mencrypt();
    console.log(encrypt); // Output: æ÷áæ£ ¡
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

To decrypt a string

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript">
    var mencdec = new mEncDec("æ÷áæ£ ¡");
    var decrypt = mencdec.mdecrypt();
    console.log(decrypt); // Output: test123
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
